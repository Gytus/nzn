          <p class="">
            The Tiger II is a German heavy tank of the Second World War. The
            final official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf.
            B, often shortened to Tiger B. The ordnance inventory designation
            was Sd.Kfz. 182. (Sd.Kfz. 267 and 268 for command vehicles). It was
            also known informally as the Königstiger (German for Bengal tiger
            and also, literally, "King Tiger"). Contemporaneous Allied soldiers
            usually called it the King Tiger or Royal Tiger.

          <p class="">
            The Panzerkampfwagen IV (Pz.Kpfw. IV), commonly known as the Panzer
            IV, is a German medium tank developed in the late 1930s and used
            extensively during the Second World War. Its ordnance inventory
            designation was Sd.Kfz. 161. The Panzer IV was the most numerous
            German tank and the second-most numerous German fully tracked
            armoured fighting vehicle of the Second World War; 8,553 Panzer IVs
            of all versions were built during World War II, only exceeded by the
            StuG III assault gun with 10,086 vehicles. Its chassis was also used
            as the base for many other fighting vehicles, including the
            Sturmgeschütz IV assault gun, the Jagdpanzer IV self-propelled
            anti-tank gun, the Wirbelwind self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, and
            the Brummbär self-propelled gun.

          <p class="">
            Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus (English: 'mouse') was a German World War
            II super-heavy tank completed in late 1944. It is the heaviest fully
            enclosed armored fighting vehicle ever built. Five were ordered, but
            only two hulls and one turret were completed, the turret being
            attached before the testing grounds were captured by advancing
            Soviet military forces. This vehicle was also built to compete with
            the Soviet heavy Kliment Voroshilov tank.

          <p class="">
            The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank from World War II. When introduced,
            its 76.2 mm (3 in) tank gun was more powerful than its
            contemporaries, and its 60-degree sloped armour provided good
            protection against anti-tank weapons. The T-34 had a profound effect
            on the conflict on the Eastern Front, and had a long-lasting impact
            on tank design. The tank was praised by multiple German generals
            when encountered during Operation Barbarossa, although its armour
            and armament were surpassed later in the war. Though, its main
            strength was its cost and production time, meaning that German
            panzer forces would often fight against Soviet tank forces several
            times their size. The T-34 is also a critical part of the mechanized
            divisions that form the backbone of the Deep Battle Strategy.

          <p class="">
            The M4 Sherman, officially Medium Tank, M4, was the most widely used
            medium tank by the United States and Western Allies in World War II.
            The M4 Sherman proved to be reliable, relatively cheap to produce,
            and available in great numbers. It was also the basis of several
            other armored fighting vehicles including self-propelled artillery,
            tank destroyers, and armored recovery vehicles. Tens of thousands
            were distributed through the Lend-Lease program to the British
            Commonwealth and Soviet Union. The tank was named by the British
            after the American Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman.
